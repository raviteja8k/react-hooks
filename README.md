## Understanding React Hooks
React Hooks (not lifecycle hooks) are something that let you write Functional Components and still hook into class-based features and use them.

### UseState() is more like this.state to initiate state for function based components

### UseEffect() allow us to handle our logic in lifecycle methods.
Itâ€™s equivalent of componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate from lifestyle hooks.
